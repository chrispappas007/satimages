# Disappaering Glaciers at Glacier National Park

For my final project, I wanted to practice processing and using satellite imagery in web mapping. I had initially wanted to examine satellite imagery around Mayan sites in Mexico, but was unable to find suitable imagery (likely due to my poor Spanish). I instead settled on examining the glaciers at [Glacier National Park (GLNP)](https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm). 

The [USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center (NOROCK)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock) recently published approximately 50 years of data on the reduction of glaciers in GLNP ([Retreat of Glaciers in Glacier National Park](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/science/retreat-glaciers-glacier-national-park?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)). Using aerial photography and satellite imagery, they carefully mapped the boundaries of each glacier over the 50-year period of available data. Their data is available for download [here](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/science/time-series-glacier-retreat?qt-science_center_objects=4#qt-science_center_objects). They found that ALL glaciers in GLNP have reduced in size over the study period with an average reduction of 39%.

Using [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), I downloaded aerial imagery from Landsat (TM) 5 in 2009 and Landsat (OLI/TILRS) 8 in 2017. The imagery from earlier Landsat missions was also available, but the earlier imagery was collected using 4 bands (Landsat 5 used 7 bands and Landsat 8 uses 11) and proved difficult for me to render effectively. I wanted to use imagery from approximately the same time of year as well but often was stymied by cloud cover. In the end, I used images from early October of 2009 and late September of 2017. 

The [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) [tutorial for processing satellite imagery](https://www.mapbox.com/help/processing-satellite-imagery/) is excellent and made this project much easier to assemble. The processing of the images is done within your terminal shell using [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), [libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/), and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php). I did find that my images required more color processing than was used in the tutorial, specifically to tweak brightness and color saturation. I also found that it is important to correct your photos before you georeference them. Opening them again to edit created problems with the projection. 

Once processed, I uploaded each image to [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) as a new tileset and then added them to an existing style ([Outdoors-V10](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/outdoors-v10.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0)). Although I removed the no-data values from the imagery, a black band is drawn around each image. This is not visible locally, so I am assuming this is caused by Mapbox. 

Having these images as a part of a style meant that I could then build a map that allowed the user to cycle between that images. I use [Assembly.css](https://www.mapbox.com/assembly/) for my map layout, and [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for the rest of the build. 

To complete my map, I downloaded road and trail shapefiles from the [National Park Service (NPS)](https://irma.nps.gov/Portal) and [glacier boundary shapefiles for 2005 and 2015](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542?community=Northern+Rocky+Mountain+Science+Center) from NOROCK. I used [Mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org/) to examine each shapefile, simplify the geometry, reduce coordinate precision, and filter and rename fields. 

Overall, Iâ€™ve really enjoyed digging into Mapbox and see myself using it more in the future. The style specifications do take some time to work through, but the tutorials and examples make it easier understand.
